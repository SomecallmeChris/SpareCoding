PURPOSE:
  The purpose of this project is to create a 'Estate Agent' style property management system.
  It's not inteded to use this project for any commercial needs and is more of way to practice SQL & C# programming.

DEPENDENCIES:
  There is a function included to create an initial login table for the database "Estate". However, if you wish to create
  your own login table then the project will run with your desired login table.

  The project also requires you to create the initial propertySales table (can be empty), as the code to create it isn't yet
  implemented.

  The main function is where the details for your MySql server must be entered for the program to gain access.
  
  This project is very much still in development, so please keep that in mind!
